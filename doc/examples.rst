========

Here we will compute some examples to show the different functionalities
of the hubbard package. The systems that we will study in the examples section
can be also found in the `examples <https://github.com/dipc-cc/hubbard/tree/master/examples>`_ folder in the main repository.
One can also go through this section to explore more examples suitable to solve with the hubbard package.
