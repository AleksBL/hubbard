# hubbard Examples #

Here we will compute different real examples to show the different functinalities
of the hubbard package. The systems that we will study in the examples section
can be found in this [examples][examples] folder in the main repository.

## Simulation of electron correlations in a molecule ##

[Here][example-kondo] we will find the self-consistent solution
of a finite molecule using the mean field hubbard model.

## Simulation of electron correlations in a periodic system ##

[Here][example-periodic] we will find the self-consistent solution
of a periodic system using the mean field hubbard model.

## Simulation of electron correlations in open-quantum system ##

[Here][example-open] we will find the self-consistent solution
for an open-quantum system using the mean field hubbard model.
