\begin{abstract}
We analyze the double-triangulene geometries (1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-blocks) with MFH using up to third nearest neighbors model ($t_{1}=-2.7$ eV, $t_{2}=-0.2$ eV, $t_{3}=-0.18$ eV). We show the spin polarization for $ U=3.0$ eV, the wavefunction and density of states spatial distributions for $U=0$ and $3.0$ eV, and the dependency of the singlet-triplet transition energy as a function of the Coulomb repulsion parameter $U$. The molecules with more than 1-block have Hydrogen passivated sites which are indicated with blue circles.
