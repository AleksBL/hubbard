\begin{abstract}
We study cases for $n=3, m=1, 2$ and $w=4,6,8$ and also compare to the known SSH model in its two topological phases. We show the band structures of the SSH model and chGNRs indicating the topological invariant $Z_{2}$ obtained as $Z_{2}=e^{-i\sum_{n_{occ}}\gamma_{n}}$, where $\gamma_{n}$ is the Zak phase along band $n$. We also show the behavior of the HOMO and LUMO wavefunctions along the lower edge of a \emph{finite} ribbon of 15 p.u. and the dependency of the HOMO-LUMO gap as a function of the (finite) chGNR length. We also show the bulk density of states (infinite ribbon) and the surface density of states (semi-infinite ribbon), where it can be seen that there appears a peak at zero at the surface. All calculations here were performed with first nearest neighbors ($t=-2.7$ eV) and $U=0$.

%\textbf{Inversion symmetry}:\\
%
%
%The presence of inversion symmetry provides another way to find the topological invariant, which can be determined from the knowledge pf the parity of the occupied band eigenstates at the time-reversal invariant momenta ($\Gamma$ and $X$). This statement has been proven for 2D and 3D topological insulators in ref. \cite{Fu2007}. Summarizing, in \emph{topological} 1D-insulators there will be an odd number of bands that invert their parity with respect to these two $k$-points, while in the trivial insulators there will be an \emph{even} number of bands that will invert their symmetry.
